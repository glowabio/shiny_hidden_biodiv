a,Solenodon,-71.02929561,19.28070402,Functional,Sensory orientation and social behaviors of Solenodons,"Solenodons are rare, nocturnal, and poorly studied. Their behavior is difficult to observe in the wild","Understanding the use of possible echolocation and social dynamics in this ancient, venomous mammal can provide insights into mammalian evolution and ecological roles."
b,Glass sponges,-142.701517,50.99562993,Spatial,Deep-sea glass sponges ,"They inhabit remote deep-sea environments, particularly around Antarctica, making them logistically difficult to study.","Glass sponges may be among the longest-lived animals on Earth and can form up to 90% of Antarctic benthic communities, playing critical roles in deep-sea ecosystems."

c,Devils Hole Pupfish,-117.4054389,42.34332542,Spatial,Extreme range restricted Devils Hole pupfish,"This species is confined to a single, remote water-filled cavern in Nevada, making it highly vulnerable and difficult to study.","Understanding how species persist in extreme, isolated habitats is crucial for conservation biology. This pupfish is critically endangered due to anthropogenic pressures."
d,Marine megafauna,-105.6942916,-38.81644272,Spatial,Poorly understood diversity and classification of marine megafauna,Limted sightings ,Taxonomic uncertainty in megafauna like squids could limits effective conservation and sustainable resource management despite their ecological and economic importance.

f,Birds of Paradise,143.0504769,-5.165372122,Functional,Courtship behavior and ecological function of isolated bird-of-paradise species,"These species occur in highly restricted, often isolated mountain rainforest habitats, and their elaborate courtship displays remain poorly studied in the wild.",Understanding the function and evolution of complex behavioral traits in isolated taxa such as Parotia lawesii can shed light on sexual selection and speciation
g,Dendrobium,109.3223727,35.04210349,Genetic,Non-monophyletic genetic structure of the orchid genus Dendrobium,"Despite being one of the largest orchid genera, genetic studies reveal complex diversity suggesting it is not monophyletic. Taxonomic revisions are ongoing.","Unresolved genetic structure complicates conservation, taxonomy, and the understanding of evolutionary relationships. Up to 50 potential genera have been proposed."
h,Thaumarchaeota,10.94873544,50.10269173,Taxonomic,"Taxonomic recognition and ecological role of Thaumarchaeota, whose recently validated name is Thermoproteota.",Recently proposed phylum with key chemolithoautotrophic functions. ,"Thaumarchaeota drive crucial processes like ammonia oxidation and nitrification in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, including deep oligotrophic lakes such as Lake Constance."
